# Contributing

I don't expect many contributions to this project, largely because Salesforce has a poor story for incorporating cross-organization shared infrastructure code into your own Salesforce org.

I currently don't expect to spend time updating this project.

However, if you would like to contribute, here are two ways:

1) Submit a pull request with your recommended changes.
2) Open an issue with a note of what's missing or incorrect. The purpose of doing this is sharing your knowledge with other people who come to this project after you.
